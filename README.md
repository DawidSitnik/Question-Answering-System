# Question Answering System
*Authors: Dawid Sitnik, Natalia Jakubiak, Piotr Czajkowski*

## Introduction
The problem that we are going to face during our project is question answering challenge where we are given some piece of the context in which we need to find an answer to the particular question. The answer is always quote from the context. 

The issue seems to be quite trivial while solving by humans, but upon further observation, it demands a lot of complex tasks for a machine, which should finally understand the contextual meaning of each word from context and question as well. Than using an abstract understanding of the question it should extract the correct section of the context.

For this task we are going to test different techniques of question answering, point their adventages and disadventages and decide which one performs the best. The methods which we are going to inspect are:
* **BiDAF model**
* **BERT model**
* **Classical ML approaches like xGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression etc.**
